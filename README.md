Description: The purpose of this study was to investigate how COVID-19 impacted access to cancer screening and treatment in a racially- and ethnically- diverse population, by studying the participants of the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study. Findings revealed unique associations between sex, race, ethnicity, age, education and comorbidities and the likelihood of changing lifestyle, health-related behaviors, and cancer screening uptake during a pandemic.
